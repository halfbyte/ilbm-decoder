# Naive IFF-ILBM Decoder

Parsing and displaying IFF ILBM format files in pure JavaScript. Because I can.

## Caveats

This needs to be properly encapsulated, refactored and tested against more images, it is currently not more than just a proof of concept.

## Usage

Open up index.html in Chrome and drop a valid IFF-ILBM. The parser currently ignores a lot of things. If you need a more complete solution, look here:

(I wrote this as a fun exercise to see how quickly I would manage to decode the format)
